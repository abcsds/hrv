Scripts in order of usage:
 - 01: Simple list ble devices.
   - 01a: Search for a specific ble device.
 - 02: Collect the HR and RR and print them to the screen.
 - 03: Stream the HR and RR data with LSL.
 - 04: Check an XDF file written with the last script.
 - 05: Connect to multiple ble devices, and broadcast for each two streams.
  - 05a: Search for multiple devices.
  - 05b: Connect to multiple devices, no LSL just print.
 - 06: A simple GUI for LSL.
 - 07: Receive and print LSL data.
 - 08: A simple plot from LSL data.
 - 09: Larger visualization of different HRV variables.

TODO:
Compare time deltas.
Compare same subject, multiple devices.
Extract ECG from Polar H10.
Compare RR to HR, ECG to HR, and ECG to RR.
